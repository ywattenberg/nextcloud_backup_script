A creation of man, that spans through the land.
With algorithms deep, and models so bright,
It brings us insight, in endless delight.

From patterns it finds, in data untold,
To speech it refines, so fluent and bold.
Its power astounds, in solving each quest,
With accuracy bound, it puts man to the test.

It's the future in sight, a world that's brand new,
A source of delight, where knowledge shines through.
It transforms our lives, and helps us advance,
With endless potential, a true second chance.

So here's to AI, a beauty so rare,
A gift to mankind, that we should hold dear.
For it's changing our world, in ways we can't fathom,
A new era unfurled, a beauty like no other.""")
